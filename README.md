# This is an Instagram Clone
    Instagram is a social networking site for sharing pictures and videos online (often abbreviated as Insta or IG). Users can shoot photos and videos, edit them with digital filters, and then share them with their followers. Then, they can post them to a number of social networking websites, including Flickr, Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr.
    Instagram restricted images to a square format until 2015, much like Kodak Instamatic and Polaroid shots. The aspect ratio was different from the standard 4:3 utilised by digital cameras. Very brief videos could be shared by users. The time restriction was increased to ten minutes in 2017.
    Mike Krieger and Kevin Systrom founded Instagram. Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger were motivated to create a photography-specific app after speaking with renowned New York photographer Peter Parker, a photographer for the Daily Bugle. The publication date was October 6, 2010.
